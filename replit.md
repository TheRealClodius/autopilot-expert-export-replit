# Multi-Agent Slack Autopilot Expert System

## Overview

This is a multi-agent AI system built with FastAPI that processes Slack messages using multiple specialized AI agents. The system uses Google Gemini models, vector search with Pinecone, and Redis for memory management to provide intelligent responses to user queries about project information.

## System Architecture

The system follows a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents handling different responsibilities:

- **Slack Gateway Agent**: Interfaces with Slack API for message processing
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates other agents and creates execution plans using Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Client Agent**: Generates user-friendly responses using Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Observer Agent**: Learns from conversations to improve system knowledge using Gemini 2.5 Flash

The architecture supports both real-time message processing and background knowledge updates through Celery workers.

## Key Components

### Agents
- `agents/slack_gateway.py` - Handles Slack message ingestion and response delivery
- `agents/orchestrator_agent.py` - Main coordination agent using Gemini 2.5 Pro for query analysis
- `agents/client_agent.py` - Response generation agent using Gemini 2.5 Flash
- `agents/observer_agent.py` - Learning agent that updates knowledge using Gemini 2.5 Flash

### Tools
- `tools/vector_search.py` - Pinecone vector database search capabilities
- `tools/perplexity_search.py` - Real-time web search using Perplexity API
- `tools/outlook_meeting.py` - Microsoft Graph API integration for meeting management

### Services
- `services/memory_service.py` - Redis-based memory management for conversations and context
- `services/embedding_service.py` - SentenceTransformer embeddings and Pinecone operations
- `services/slack_connector.py` - Slack API integration with rate limiting
- `services/data_processor.py` - Message preprocessing for embedding storage

### Background Processing
- `workers/knowledge_update_worker.py` - Celery tasks for daily Slack data ingestion
- `celery_app.py` - Celery configuration with task queues

## Data Flow

1. **Message Reception**: Slack Gateway receives messages via webhook
2. **Query Analysis**: Orchestrator Agent analyzes query and creates execution plan
3. **Information Gathering**: Vector search tool retrieves relevant information from Pinecone knowledge base
4. **Response Generation**: Client Agent generates persona-based response using Gemini Flash
5. **Learning**: Observer Agent analyzes conversations for insights
6. **Background Updates**: Daily ingestion worker processes new Slack data

The system uses vector search to retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base, then generates responses using AI expertise and gathered context.

## External Dependencies

### AI Services
- **Google Gemini**: Gemini 2.5 Pro for orchestration, Gemini 2.5 Flash for response generation
- **SentenceTransformers**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for text embeddings

### Infrastructure
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for similarity search
- **Redis**: Memory management and caching
- **Slack API**: Message processing and response delivery

### Python Libraries
- FastAPI for web framework
- Celery for background task processing
- NetworkX for graph operations
- Pydantic for data validation

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for containerized deployment with the following components:

1. **Web Application**: FastAPI server handling Slack webhooks
2. **Celery Workers**: Background processing for knowledge updates
3. **Redis**: Memory and task queue backend
4. **External Services**: Pinecone, Slack API, and Gemini API integration

The system uses environment variables for configuration management and supports both development and production environments.

✅ **June 29, 2025 - CRITICAL SLACK MENTION PROCESSING FIX IMPLEMENTED (PRODUCTION READY)**
- **Root Cause Identified**: Slack Gateway was completely removing user mentions `<@USER123>` instead of preserving them in readable format
- **Enhanced Text Cleaning**: Updated `_clean_message_text()` to convert `<@USER123>` → `@UserName` while preserving mention context
- **User Information Resolution**: Added async user lookup to extract actual names from Slack API when available
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: System converts mentions to `@Unknown` when user info unavailable, ensuring mentions are never lost
- **Comprehensive Mention Support**: Added support for channel mentions, URL formatting, and proper whitespace handling

- **Slack Permissions Note**: Requires `users:read` scope for full name resolution, gracefully falls back to generic format
- **Production Impact**: Eliminates the critical issue where user mentions were invisible to the agent

✅ **June 29, 2025 - GENERALIZED REACT PATTERN FOR ALL TOOLS IMPLEMENTED (PRODUCTION READY)**
- **Universal Tool Retry System**: Implemented generalized ReAct pattern (Reason → Act → Observe → Reason → Act) for ALL tools, not just Atlassian-specific
- **5-Loop Maximum with HITL**: System automatically retries failed tool operations up to 5 times, then escalates to Human-in-the-Loop intervention
- **AI-Powered Failure Analysis**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to analyze any tool failure and determine intelligent corrections (syntax errors, parameter issues, format problems)
- **Cross-Tool Intelligence**: Pattern works for Atlassian (CQL syntax), Vector Search (query optimization), Perplexity (parameter validation), and Outlook Meeting (data formatting)
- **Automatic Syntax Correction**: When tools report syntax errors (400 Bad Request, etc.), orchestrator automatically reasons about corrections and retries
- **Progressive Error Handling**: Each retry attempt uses AI reasoning to adjust approach - no manual intervention required for common syntax issues
- **HITL Escalation Logic**: After 5 failed attempts, system provides clear error message indicating human intervention may be required
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Users see reasoning, retry attempts, and escalation decisions through live progress updates
- **Fallback Heuristics**: When AI reasoning fails, system uses proven heuristic patterns for common tool failure scenarios
- **Complete Tool Coverage**: Generalized pattern applied to atlassian_search, vector_search, perplexity_search, and outlook_meeting tools
- **Method Architecture**: `_execute_tool_action_with_generalized_retry()` handles any tool with `_generalized_failure_reasoning()` for intelligent corrections
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Consistency**: Fixed orchestrator to use Pro model for both query analysis AND failure reasoning (corrected from Flash)
- **Files Modified**: agents/orchestrator_agent.py (replaced tool-specific retry with universal pattern, fixed model usage)
- **Key Improvement**: Addresses user requirement "orchestrator should retry if tool says syntax is wrong, do its best to answer, 5 loops max then HITL"
- **Status**: Production-ready universal ReAct pattern ensuring robust tool execution across all integrated systems with consistent Pro-level reasoning

✅ **June 29, 2025 - CRITICAL PRODUCTION BUG FIXED: "Unknown Action" Error Eliminated (PRODUCTION READY)**
- **Root Cause Identified**: Orchestrator execution layer was failing to recognize MCP format actions due to variable scope bug in action_type extraction
- **Critical Issue**: `action_type = action.get("type")` was looking for legacy format but orchestrator generates modern MCP format `{"mcp_tool": "confluence_search"}`
- **Fix Applied**: Updated `_execute_tool_action_with_generalized_retry` method to handle both formats: `action_type = action.get("mcp_tool") or action.get("type", "unknown_action")`
