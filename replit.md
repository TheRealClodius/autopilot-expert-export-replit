# Multi-Agent Slack Autopilot Expert System

## Overview

This is a multi-agent AI system built with FastAPI that processes Slack messages using multiple specialized AI agents. The system uses Google Gemini models, vector search with Pinecone, and Redis for memory management to provide intelligent responses to user queries about project information.

## System Architecture

The system follows a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents handling different responsibilities:

- **Slack Gateway Agent**: Interfaces with Slack API for message processing
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates other agents and creates execution plans using Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Client Agent**: Generates user-friendly responses using Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Observer Agent**: Learns from conversations to improve system knowledge using Gemini 2.5 Flash

The architecture supports both real-time message processing and background knowledge updates through Celery workers.

## Key Components

✅ **June 29, 2025 - CRITICAL SLACK MENTION PROCESSING FIX IMPLEMENTED (PRODUCTION READY)**
- **Root Cause Identified**: Slack Gateway was completely removing user mentions `<@USER123>` instead of preserving them in readable format
- **Enhanced Text Cleaning**: Updated `_clean_message_text()` to convert `<@USER123>` → `@UserName` while preserving mention context
- **User Information Resolution**: Added async user lookup to extract actual names from Slack API when available
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: System converts mentions to `@Unknown` when user info unavailable, ensuring mentions are never lost
- **Comprehensive Mention Support**: Added support for channel mentions, URL formatting, and proper whitespace handling
- **API Integration**: Enhanced function to properly fetch user profiles and extract first names for natural mention display
- **Fixed User Mention Bug**: Users can now tag people with `@person` and the agent will see and process those mentions correctly
- **Files Modified**: agents/slack_gateway.py (enhanced `_clean_message_text` method with async user resolution)
- **Testing Verified**: All mention formats properly converted to readable format while preserving context
- **Slack Permissions Note**: Requires `users:read` scope for full name resolution, gracefully falls back to generic format
- **Production Impact**: Eliminates the critical issue where user mentions were invisible to the agent

✅ **June 29, 2025 - GENERALIZED REACT PATTERN FOR ALL TOOLS IMPLEMENTED (PRODUCTION READY)**
- **Universal Tool Retry System**: Implemented generalized ReAct pattern (Reason → Act → Observe → Reason → Act) for ALL tools, not just Atlassian-specific
- **5-Loop Maximum with HITL**: System automatically retries failed tool operations up to 5 times, then escalates to Human-in-the-Loop intervention
- **AI-Powered Failure Analysis**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to analyze any tool failure and determine intelligent corrections (syntax errors, parameter issues, format problems)
- **Cross-Tool Intelligence**: Pattern works for Atlassian (CQL syntax), Vector Search (query optimization), Perplexity (parameter validation), and Outlook Meeting (data formatting)
- **Automatic Syntax Correction**: When tools report syntax errors (400 Bad Request, etc.), orchestrator automatically reasons about corrections and retries
- **Progressive Error Handling**: Each retry attempt uses AI reasoning to adjust approach - no manual intervention required for common syntax issues
- **HITL Escalation Logic**: After 5 failed attempts, system provides clear error message indicating human intervention may be required
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Users see reasoning, retry attempts, and escalation decisions through live progress updates
- **Fallback Heuristics**: When AI reasoning fails, system uses proven heuristic patterns for common tool failure scenarios
- **Complete Tool Coverage**: Generalized pattern applied to atlassian_search, vector_search, perplexity_search, and outlook_meeting tools
- **Method Architecture**: `_execute_tool_action_with_generalized_retry()` handles any tool with `_generalized_failure_reasoning()` for intelligent corrections
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Consistency**: Fixed orchestrator to use Pro model for both query analysis AND failure reasoning (corrected from Flash)
- **Files Modified**: agents/orchestrator_agent.py (replaced tool-specific retry with universal pattern, fixed model usage)
- **Key Improvement**: Addresses user requirement "orchestrator should retry if tool says syntax is wrong, do its best to answer, 5 loops max then HITL"
- **Status**: Production-ready universal ReAct pattern ensuring robust tool execution across all integrated systems with consistent Pro-level reasoning
