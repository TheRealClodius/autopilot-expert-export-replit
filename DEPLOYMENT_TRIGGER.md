# Critical Production Bug Fix - Ready for Deployment

## Issue Identified
The bot was appearing unresponsive in Slack due to a data structure mismatch between the orchestrator and client agent.

## Root Cause
- **Orchestrator** built state stack with `"current_query"` key
- **Client Agent** expected `"query"` key  
- **Result**: Client agent logged "No user query found in state stack" and returned None

## Fix Applied
Updated `agents/orchestrator_agent.py` in two locations:

### Line 284 (normal state stack):
```python
state_stack = {
    "query": message.text,  # Added this line - client agent expects this key
    "current_query": {
        "text": message.text,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

### Line 325 (error fallback state stack):
```python
return {
    "query": message.text,  # Added this line - client agent expects this key  
    "current_query": {
        "text": message.text,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

## Impact After Deployment
✅ Bot will respond to all Slack messages instead of appearing unresponsive  
✅ Fixes the exact conversation shown in the screenshot  
✅ Maintains all existing functionality  
✅ No breaking changes

## Files Changed
- `agents/orchestrator_agent.py` (2 lines added - fixes state stack mismatch)
- `agents/client_agent.py` (2 lines changed - fixes response truncation)
- `prompts.yaml` (2 lines added - adds conciseness + Slack formatting guidance)
- `utils/gemini_client.py` (request queue system added - prevents rate limiting)
- `replit.md` (documentation updated)

## Additional Fix - Response Truncation
- **Issue**: Responses cut off mid-sentence due to 500 token limit
- **Fix**: Increased max_tokens from 500 to 1,500 and character limit from 2,000 to 4,000
- **Result**: Full responses will no longer be truncated prematurely

## Additional Fix - Simple Rate Limiting  
- **Issue**: Potential rate limiting after 4 rapid message exchanges causing "Sorry, I couldn't process your request"
- **Fix**: Implemented simple 100ms delay between Gemini API calls to prevent rate limiting
- **Result**: Prevents API rate limits while maintaining system stability
- **Benefits**: Lightweight solution that doesn't break initialization process

## Pre-Deployment Testing Protocol
**MANDATORY: Always test the server before deployment**

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/health
```
Expected: `{"status":"healthy","service":"autopilot-expert"}`

### 2. System Status Check
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/admin/system-status
```
Expected: All components showing as operational

### 3. Agent Response Test
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/admin/orchestrator-test?query=Hello"
```
Expected: Valid response with text and suggestions

### 4. Server Startup Verification
- Check workflow logs for successful initialization
- Verify no error messages during startup
- Confirm all agents loaded properly

## Verification Completed
✅ Server health check passed  
✅ Agent response system tested  
✅ All fixes verified locally

**Status**: Ready for deployment after successful testing protocol.
