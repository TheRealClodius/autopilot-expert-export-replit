# Critical Production Bug Fix - Ready for Deployment

## Issue Identified
The bot was appearing unresponsive in Slack due to a data structure mismatch between the orchestrator and client agent.

## Root Cause
- **Orchestrator** built state stack with `"current_query"` key
- **Client Agent** expected `"query"` key  
- **Result**: Client agent logged "No user query found in state stack" and returned None

## Fix Applied
Updated `agents/orchestrator_agent.py` in two locations:

### Line 284 (normal state stack):
```python
state_stack = {
    "query": message.text,  # Added this line - client agent expects this key
    "current_query": {
        "text": message.text,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

### Line 325 (error fallback state stack):
```python
return {
    "query": message.text,  # Added this line - client agent expects this key  
    "current_query": {
        "text": message.text,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

## Impact After Deployment
✅ Bot will respond to all Slack messages instead of appearing unresponsive  
✅ Fixes the exact conversation shown in the screenshot  
✅ Maintains all existing functionality  
✅ No breaking changes

## Files Changed
- `agents/orchestrator_agent.py` (2 lines added)
- `replit.md` (documentation updated)

## Verification
The fix has been verified locally - the client agent now successfully finds the query in the state stack.

**Status**: Ready for immediate deployment to resolve production issue.
